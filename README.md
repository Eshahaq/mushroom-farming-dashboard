# Business Performance Dashboard â€“ Jamur Mr. Pj Farming

#ðŸ”Ž Overview
This dashboard was developed using dummy data inspired by a real mushroom farming business (Jamur Mr. Pj). The goal is to analyze business performance from several perspectives: production, sales, revenue, harvest efficiency, and debt repayment capacity. The dataset simulates activities across multiple kumbung (mushroom houses) and external sales channels.

#ðŸ“ˆ Key Metrics
Baglog Produced: 7,500
Total Harvest: 427.80 Kg
Total Revenue: Rp49,880,020

#ðŸ’¡ Insights
1. The largest revenue source comes from baglog sales (Rp37,000,000/74%), followed by mushroom sales (Rp11,080,020/22%), and rent (Rp1,800,000/4%).
2. This shows the business is still highly dependent on baglog distribution. Thereâ€™s potential to grow mushroom sales for better revenue balance.
3. External markets absorb a large number of baglogs (Up 1,500 units).
4. Among internal kumbung, K1 and K2 are the most active buyers, aligning with their stronger harvest results.
5. Scatter plot indicates a positive relationship between baglog usage and harvest yield.
6. However, not all kumbung are equally efficient. For example:
- K2 produced the highest harvest (127.80 Kg) from 900 baglogs.
- K3 produced only 51.20 Kg from 800 baglogs â†’ lowest efficiency.
7. Clear performance gap indicates best practices from K2 and K1 should be replicated in other kumbung.
8. K2 (36.74%) and K4 (32.11%) have the highest capacity for debt repayment, reflecting stronger financial positions.
9. K3 (16.36%) is the weakest contributor, again signaling low productivity and financial output.

#ðŸš€ Recommendations
1. Scale up mushroom sales to reduce reliance on baglog distribution.
2. Adopt K2â€™s farming practices in other kumbung to improve overall efficiency.
3. Investigate low performance in K3 (possible issues: environment, maintenance, or labor).
4. Utilize revenue insights for better debt management planning.
