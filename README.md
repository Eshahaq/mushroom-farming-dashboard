# Business Performance Dashboard â€“ Jamur Mr. Pj Farming

#ðŸ”Ž Overview
This project presents a business performance dashboard for Jamur Mr. Pj (mushroom farming). The dataset used here is dummy data, but it is inspired by a real mushroom cultivation business model. The goal is to showcase data analysis and visualization skills by simulating real business cases. The dashboard helps to:
- Monitor production (baglogs & harvest).
- Track revenue sources.
- Evaluate kumbung (mushroom house) performance.
- Assess debt repayment progress.

ðŸ”¨ Data Analysis Workflow
1. Data Preparation
- Compiled dummy dataset with structure reflecting real mushroom farming.
- Standardized key metrics: Kg for harvest, Rp for revenue.
2. Data Cleaning
- Checked missing values.
- Ensured consistency across financial and production data.
3. Calculated Fields
- Debt Repayment % = (Initial Debt â€“ Remaining Debt) / Initial Debt.
- Total Revenue = Revenue of Baglog+Mushroom+Rent.
4. Data Visualization (Tableau Dashboard)
- KPIs: Baglog produced, total harvest (Kg), total revenue (Rp).
- Bar Chart: Baglog Sales Distribution.
- Bar Chart: Revenue Contribution by source.
- Scatter Plot: Harvest Efficiency (Baglogs vs. Kg).
- Bar Chart: Kumbung Performance by Harvest.
- Bubble Chart: Current Debt Repayment %.

#ðŸ’¡ Insights
1. The largest revenue source comes from baglog sales (Rp37,000,000/74%), followed by mushroom sales (Rp11,080,020/22%), and rent (Rp1,800,000/4%).
2. This shows the business is still highly dependent on baglog distribution. Thereâ€™s potential to grow mushroom sales for better revenue balance.
3. Among internal kumbung, K1 and K2 are the most active buyers, aligning with their stronger harvest results. while others (K5, K3) lag behind.
5. Scatter plot indicates a positive relationship between baglog usage and harvest yield.
6. However, not all kumbung are equally efficient. For example:
- K2 produced the highest harvest (127.80 Kg) from 900 baglogs.
- K3 produced only 51.20 Kg from 800 baglogs â†’ lowest efficiency.
7. Clear performance gap indicates best practices from K2 and K1 should be replicated in other kumbung.
8. K2 (36.74%) and K4 (32.11%) have the highest capacity for debt repayment, reflecting stronger financial positions. While K3 (16.36%) is the weakest contributor, again signaling low productivity and financial output.

#ðŸš€ Recommendations
1. Scale up mushroom sales to reduce reliance on baglog distribution.
2. Adopt K2â€™s farming practices in other kumbung to improve overall efficiency.
3. Investigate low performance in K3 (possible issues: environment, maintenance, or labor).
4. Support low-performing kumbung with training/monitoring.
5. Improve debt repayment monitoring to ensure cash flow stability.

#ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Download the dataset
2. Open Tableau or your preferred BI tool.
3. Reproduce calculated fields & visualizations following the workflow above.

#ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
1. Expand dataset with real case records for deeper analysis.
2. Add time-series analysis for trend forecasting.
3. Build interactive dashboard with filters (month, kumbung, revenue type).
